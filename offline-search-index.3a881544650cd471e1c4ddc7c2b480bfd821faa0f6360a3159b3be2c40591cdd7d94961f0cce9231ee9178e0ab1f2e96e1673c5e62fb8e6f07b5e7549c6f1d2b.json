[{"body":"Into the Breach for Vortex (ITBV) is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager that adds support for installing and managing Into the Breach mods in Vortex, just like any other supported title. To clarify, this project is not affiliated in any way with Nexus Mods, Subset Games or anyone else, and is an open-source community resource.\nStatus and Limitations ITBV is still beta-quality software! While I can test locally, I won’t be able to cover every case and there is a high potential for bugs that haven’t been found yet, especially with how small the modding scene for Into the Breach is. The following is definitely supported at this point:\n Installing mods: Installing mods from archive files works, deploying directly to your game’s mods folder. Managing mods: The standard Vortex install/enable/disable/uninstall operations should all work just as they do for any other Vortex-managed game. Profiles: Create multiple profiles for different sets of mods and quickly switch between them. Mod Loader Detection: Vortex will warn you if it doesn’t detect an installed mod loader and will install loaders to your game folder correctly.   If you’re really missing specific features you can open an issue and we can discuss the viability, or find me on the Nexus Mods Discord.\n Nexus Mods To be clear and upfront: being supported in Vortex (using ITBV) does not mean that the Nexus Mods or Vortex team officially supports this extension or any mods you install using it. See the FAQ for extra details.\n","excerpt":"Into the Breach for Vortex (ITBV) is an unofficial extension for the …","ref":"/docs/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with ITBV and managing Into the Breach mods with Vortex.

You don’t! If you prefer installing and managing your mods manually, or using any other modding tools, I recommend using them! ITBV is just an alternate method of installing mods for those who are more familiar with Vortex already.\nI’m a mod/pack author, how do I make mods compatible with Vortex? They probably already are! If you want to maximise support and avoid some issues, pack your mod archive in such a way that the root of the archive should end up at the root of the user’s mods directory, and that’s basically it.\nThe installer will auto-detect the usual folders (resources, scripts etc) and ignore anything above it, so feel free to lay out your archive how you like as long as the actual mod files are in the right place.\nWhat about mods that aren’t on the Nexus? They should still work fine! As long as they’re compatible with your current game version, Vortex can try and install it anyway. Remember that non-Nexus mods won’t have quite the same metadata available in Vortex you might be used to.\n","excerpt":"Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can …","ref":"/docs/introduction/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"body":"Quick Start The fastest way to get started is to just open the Games page in Vortex and scroll down through the unmanaged games. You should see an entry for Into the Breach in there. Click Manage on that entry and follow the prompts to install the extension and restart Vortex. You should be good to go and try installing some mods!\nInstalling the Extension If the quick start doesn’t work or you want to install the extension yourself, there’s a couple of different ways to do that! Unless you’ve got a pretty specific use case, you’ll probably want one of the two automatic methods, but manual installation is available as well.\nAutomatic Installation  This is the easiest way to install!\n  Open up Vortex, and open the Extensions panel from the left sidebar. Click Find more to open the list of Extensions Find Into the Breach Support and click Install Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Into the Breach in your Games screen and you’re ready to install some mods!\nSemi-Automatic Installation If you can’t install directly from the Extensions screen, you can instead install from the archive.\n Download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub Open the Extensions panel in Vortex Click on the Drop File(s) box in the corner and locate the archive you downloaded. Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Into the Breach in your Games screen and you’re ready to install some mods!\nManual Installation  Only attempt this if you absolutely have to. It becomes much harder to debug and much harder to upgrade.\n If you want to install the extension yourself, you will have to install the actual extension files manually. Make sure you close Vortex before proceeding.\nFirst, download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub.\nNext, unpack the archive to somewhere convenient. You should have a directory named game-intothebreach with four files inside:\n info.json index.js gameart.png  Now, copy the whole directory to your Vortex folder. You can easily open your Vortex folder by opening a new File Explorer window and entering the following in to the location bar: %APPDATA%/Vortex and then opening the plugins directory (create it if it doesn’t exist).\nOnce you’re done, you should have four files at the following locations:\nC:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-intothebreach\\info.json C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-intothebreach\\index.js C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-intothebreach\\gameart.png With those files in place, you’re clear to start Vortex and you should see the Into the Breach icon in the Games screen light up.\n","excerpt":"Quick Start The fastest way to get started is to just open the Games …","ref":"/docs/usage/installation/","title":"Installation"},{"body":"At it’s core, installing mods is roughly the same as any Vortex-enabled game, once you’ve added Into the Breach as a managed game in Vortex.\nIf you haven’t already, open the Games screen and click the Manage button on the Into the Breach icon under Unmanaged\n  Remember that mods may still need to be enabled or configured in-game from the Mod Content menu!\n Installing from Nexus Mods If you’re installing mods from Nexus Mods, you can use the “Vortex” or “Download with Mod Manager” buttons on the mod page to automatically open Vortex and download the mod. Simply Install and Enable like usual and you should be good to go.\nInstall from archives You can also download mod archives directly from Nexus Mods or anywhere else you like and install them with Vortex. Simply use the Install From File button in the toolbar or drop them onto the drop zone at the bottom of the Vortex window.\n Be aware that installing from non-Nexus archives will often not include the full metadata. You can double-click the mod in the mod list to change its details.\n Please note that Vortex can’t tell if a mod will be compatible with your current game version and mods may need to be updated to be compatible with certain game updates.\n","excerpt":"At it’s core, installing mods is roughly the same as any …","ref":"/docs/usage/mods/","title":"Installing Mods"},{"body":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/blog/releases/","title":"Releases"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with the extension and managing Into the Breach mods with Vortex.
