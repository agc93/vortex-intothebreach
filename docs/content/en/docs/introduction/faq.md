Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can give.

### Why do I need Vortex for this?

You don't! If you prefer installing and managing your mods manually, or using any other modding tools, I recommend using them! ITBV is just an alternate method of installing mods for those who are more familiar with Vortex already.

### I’m a mod/pack author, how do I make mods compatible with Vortex?

They probably already are! If you want to maximise support and avoid some issues, pack your mod archive in such a way that the root of the archive should end up at the root of the user's `mods` directory, and that’s basically it.

The installer will auto-detect the usual folders (`resources`, `scripts` etc) and ignore anything above it, so feel free to lay out your archive how you like as long as the actual mod files are in the right place.

### What about mods that aren't on the Nexus?

They should still work fine! As long as they're compatible with your current game version, Vortex can try and install it anyway. Remember that non-Nexus mods won't have quite the same metadata available in Vortex you might be used to.
