## What is it?

This is a simple Vortex extension that adds support for Into the Breach mods so that you can install game mods using the Vortex mod manager.

Using Vortex you can install, manage, track and uninstall mods for Into the Breach just like you install mods for any of your other Vortex-supported games.

## How to use it?

You should be able to immediately install the extension by finding Into the Breach in your Vortex Games list and clicking Manage. Otherwise, install it directly from the Extensions pane, by clicking Find More and searching for "Into the Breach".

> Please report any bugs or issues you find as I have only been able to complete some basic (and limited) testing with this extension.
