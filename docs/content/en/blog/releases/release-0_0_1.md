This release is the first alpha of the Into the Breach extension!

At this time we **only support the Steam** version of the game automatically. If you own the GOG (or other stores) version and can help me out with testing, please find me on the Nexus Mods Discord or raise an issue here.

You should be able to install mods for Into the Breach from archives in this release and support the basic Vortex features of install/enable/disable/deploy/purge.
