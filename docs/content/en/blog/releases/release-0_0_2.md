This release is the next alpha of the Into the Breach extension!

This release **should** add support for the Epic Games and GOG versions of the game. If you own the Epic/GOG versions and run into any problems with the game being detected, please find me on the Nexus Mods Discord or raise an [issue here](https://github.com/agc93/vortex-intothebreach/issues).

You should be able to install mods for Into the Breach from archives in this release and support the basic Vortex features of install/enable/disable/deploy/purge.
