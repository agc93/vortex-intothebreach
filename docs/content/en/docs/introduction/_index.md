  A basic introduction to Into the Breach for Vortex
---

Into the Breach for Vortex (ITBV) is an **unofficial** extension for the [Vortex mod manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) that adds support for installing and managing Into the Breach mods in Vortex, just like any other supported title. To clarify, this project is not affiliated in any way with Nexus Mods, Subset Games or anyone else, and is an open-source community resource.

## Status and Limitations

ITBV is still beta-quality software! While I can test locally, I won't be able to cover every case and there is a high potential for bugs that haven't been found yet, especially with how small the modding scene for Into the Breach is. The following is definitely supported at this point:

- **Installing mods**: Installing mods from archive files works, deploying directly to your game's `mods` folder.
- **Managing mods**: The standard Vortex install/enable/disable/uninstall operations should all work just as they do for any other Vortex-managed game.
- **Profiles**: Create multiple profiles for different sets of mods and quickly switch between them.
- **Mod Loader Detection**: Vortex will warn you if it doesn't detect an installed mod loader and will install loaders to your game folder correctly.

> If you're really missing specific features you can open an issue and we can discuss the viability, or find me on the Nexus Mods Discord.

### Nexus Mods

To be clear and upfront: being supported in Vortex (using ITBV) **does not** mean that the Nexus Mods or Vortex team officially supports this extension or any mods you install using it. See [the FAQ](/docs/introduction/faq) for extra details.
